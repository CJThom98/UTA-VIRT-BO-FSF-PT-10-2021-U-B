        Born on March 22, 1998, Cory Thompson has always considered himself a nerd. From an early age, he recognized that alot of his interests weren't inline with the mainstream. 
        From Star Wars, Star Trek, and Marvel Comics to DnD, Anime, and foreign-made video games, his nerdiness knows no bounds. Knowing his own interests, he tries to not be judgemental of what people like
        to do. His motto is: "As long as you're not hurting people or yourself, have at it!"
